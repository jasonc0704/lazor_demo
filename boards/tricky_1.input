# This is a comment
# This example is for tricky 1 in Lazor
#   x = no block allowed
#   o = blocks allowed
#   A = fixed reflect block
#   B = fixed opaque block
#   C = fixed refract block

# Grid will start at top left being 0, 0
# Step size is by half blocks
# Thus, this leads to even numbers indicating
# the rows/columns between blocks, and odd numbers
# intersecting blocks.

# Here we specify that we have 2 reflect blocks

A 2
C 1

# Now we specify that we have one lazer
#    x, y, vx, vy
# NOTE! because 0, 0 is the top left, our axis
# are as follows:
