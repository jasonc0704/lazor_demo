# Solution to the lazor game

## Current Phase

This solution can accommodate three types of blocks:
 ```
 A - Reflect
 B - Absorb
 C - Reflect and See-through
 ```
 And are thus good for the first 14 series of games (Tutorial - Grande).

 ## Tests

 The test boards are provided in boards folder. You are welcome to type your own board
 using the format within. Note, the running time depends on the size of the board and
 the number of blocks you can move, and it may be frustratingly long.
