# Solution To the Lazor Game

## Current Phase

This solution can accommodate three types of blocks:
 ```
 A - Reflect
 B - Absorb
 C - Reflect and See-through
 ```
 and is thus good for the first 14 levels of the lazor game (Tutorial - Grande).

 ## Tests

 The test boards are provided in boards folder. You are welcome to write your own board
 using the format within. Note, the running time depends on the size of the board and
 the number of blocks you can move, and may be frustratingly long.
